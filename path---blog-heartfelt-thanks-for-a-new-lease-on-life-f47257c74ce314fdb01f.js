everyone?’</p>\n<p>Thankfully, Mr Sheppard’s new heart is in perfect working order – in every respect.</p>\n<p>And the 32-year-old wants to make clear his feelings towards the people who gave him his new lease on life.</p>\n<p>‘Thank you really isn’t enough,’ Mr Sheppard said of his donor and his donor’s family.</p>\n<p>‘It’s the most generous gift that anybody could give.</p>\n<p>‘It has brought a lot of joy for me and my family but I know that there is another family out there grieving the loss or their son or daughter or husband or wife.</p>\n<p>It’s hard to put my gratitude into words.’</p>\n<p>Mr Sheppard was diagnosed with cardiomyopathy in 2017 – after several years of misdiagnosis – and he became gravely ill, with his weight dropping to 44kg.</p>\n<p>Since his heart transplant at The Alfred, however, Mr Sheppard has been thriving.</p>\n<p>In October, he participated in Melbourne’s Around The Bay 20km event and has plans to complete a 200km cycling route around rural Victoria early next year.</p>\n<p>Mr Sheppard was among those marking DonateLife Thank You Day on November 18.</p>\n<p>This national day, an initiative of the Organ and Tissue Authority (OTA), is dedicated to honouring all organ and tissue donors and their families.</p>\n<p>It also acknowledges the work of donation and transplantation specialists, joined by many other health professionals, who care for donors, recipients and their families.</p>\n<p>Each year, living and deceased donors and their families save and transform the lives of thousands of Australians through the gift of organ and tissue donation.</p>\n<p>For more information visit <a href="https://donatelife.gov.au/">https://donatelife.gov.au/</a></p>\n<p><em>Originally posted at <a
