This was enough to hospitalise him and months of tests resulted in a diagnosis of Cardiomyopathy.</p>\n<p>Cardiomyopathy affects the walls of the heart, preventing it from pumping blood around the body and eventually leading to heart failure.</p>\n<p>James's condition continued to worsen and after flatlining twice in hospital, he was put on the waiting list to receive a heart transplant.</p>\n<p>He spent eight months on the list and on 12 May this year James received a new heart.</p>\n<h2>Road to recovery</h2>\n<p>James quickly began rehab and was riding an exercise bike only 11 days after the operation, and out of hospital only two days after that.</p>\n<p>He had to take on a three month intensive rehab program and the team at the Alfred Hospital recommended he choose an enjoyable activity to do to rebuild his fitness.</p>\n<p>When he was younger James loved riding a bike, but stopped as he got older and unwell. However, he soon realised that riding was going to be the ticket to take him back to health.</p>\n<p>He got back on the bike and set a goal – the 20 kilometre United Energy Around the Bay ride. </p>\n<p>United Energy Around the Bay is this Sunday 7 October, less than five months after James's heart transplant on 12 May.</p>\n<p>He thinks it's an achievable challenge, and is currently riding about 40 kilometres a week with friends.</p>\n<p>The 20km ride is not his only goal. James also aims to complete a triathlon this summer and next August represent Australia at the World Transplant Games in Newcastle in the UK in the road cycling race.</p>\n<h2>An inspiration to others</h2>\n<p>James also hopes that his efforts can inspire others to live a healthy life and promote organ donation.</p>\n<p>If you'd like to join James at United Energy Around the Bay it's not too late – entries are still open and with free tickets for children it's easy for the whole family to come along.</p>\n<p>Originally posted at <a href=\"https://www.bicyclenetwork.com.au/newsroom/2018/10/01/james-sheppard/\">https://www.bicyclenetwork.com.au/newsroom/2018/10/01/james-sheppard/</a></p>"}}}},pathContext:{slug:"a-new-heart-to-australias-biggest-bike-ride-in-five-months"}}}});
